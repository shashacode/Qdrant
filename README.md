# Qdrant
The file titled Vectorss.py contains the code for the part of the article which talks about Creating a Qdrant collection, with appropriate payloads and showcasing different ways of payload filtering.
The dataset used to carry out the multi search is in the text_dataset.csv file
The TextEmbeddings.ipynb file contains the code for converting the Texts to Vectors using the SentenceTransformer library which was run on Google Colab GPU Instance
The multi_search.py file contains the code for the part of the article talking about performing a multi-vector search that includes payload filtering. Also, rerank the final results using the payload


Overall the codes shows how to use Qdrant for Text retrieval utilizing Payload filtering, Vectors generation and multi vector search with reranking of payloads
